MyProject9 is a 3D-platformer, where the character use walking along the platforms and jumping from one of them to another in order to achieve the last platform and survive in the fighting with the upcoming lava.
There are two types of enemies in the game: the rising lava that floods platforms and floor spikes. Collision with them leads to character's death and restart the level.
Platforms are generated by random after character's step on the last platform, so this demonstrates the simpliest mechanics of procedurally generated levelling and implement augmentation during the process of the game.
Character's movements are smooth and realised in that way in order to train gamer's dexterity.
What have not been realized, but wanted:
The process tracing and score (but the project demonstrates potential ability to realize it).
Complexity system that is needed to be done in the way of faster lava rising and increasing number of floor spikes.
Floor spikes should be up-down moving on the spawning platforms.
System of bonuses can have lava-stopping timers giving the gamer ability to manage with achieving the higher platform before the lava coming. Another bonus must be time-limited armor that will give immortality against spikes for a short pediod of time.
